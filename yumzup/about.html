<td>True to its Tag Line "A Fine Dining Experience", Hundreds Heritage mesmerizes its guest from the moment you enter.
Situated in the calm and peaceful East Gandhinagar of Vellore, it derives it's name from the owners brand "Hundred Beedies" and the fact that the structure is nearly 50 years old. 
Hence the rightful name "Hundreds Heritage". 
Attention to detail is in the soul of this restaurant,and can be seen not only in its decor but also in the food. Signature dishes such as Bharwan Tamatar ,Angora Paneer, Galouti Kabab, Tandoori Bater and Lucknowvi Biriyani highlights the Indian Cuisine. Indianised Chinese is a strict no-no here and also the Pastas,the Lasagnas,the Sizzlers are unlike any other in vicinity.Sinful desserts like Sizzling Brownie is a perfect ending to a sumptuous meal. Portions are fairly large,thus encouraging people to dine in groups rather than dining alone. 
Hundreds Heritage once again welcomes you to fine luxury dining.</td>
