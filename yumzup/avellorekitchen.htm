<td>A new Landmark of Vellore city, born out of passion for delivering healthy, hygienic, quality and tasty food, cooked to perfection.

The Vellore Kitchen (TVK) has professional Chefs, who have innate love for cooking and have worked and gained experience in the star hotels.
The Vellore Kitchen is one of the expertises in the art of cooking and dining at TVK is an experience you’ll want to share with everyone, as
the taste, texture, color, odor and presentation are astonishingly best, one could experience. It provides South Indian, North Indian, Chinese 
and Continental food varieties at one roof. TVK is a multi-cuisine restaurant and a right destination for the Non-vegetarian food lovers. 
Earlier, we had successfully operated a Canteen in the name ‘Le Cafe’ in the renowned VIT University, Vellore. During this period, we had provided 
food for many National and International conferences, festivals and functions and had earned a remarkable appreciation from the management, students
and participants.Not to be complacent with our achievements and with a view to give our taste and quality to the common public at large, we established
 a restaurant in the name ‘The Vellore Kitchen’. Being sons of the soil of Vellore, we named our restaurant with due respect for the place and profession. 
TVK is confident of giving all round taste and quality in all of the food varieties it serves - unlike others, who market a particular food variety 
like Idli, Aappam, Briyani, etc. among the people. This made our restaurant to be the most preferred and sought after place to dine in the City. 
TVK continuously updates with changing technology and prepares itself for new challenges, by acquiring the required knowledge for continuous improvement
in the chosen field. It serves to the changing needs of the customers from time-to-time and thus enjoys the credit of satisfying all its customers
