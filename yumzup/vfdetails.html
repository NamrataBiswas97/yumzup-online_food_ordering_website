Vellore Fort, built by the Nayakar chieftains of the Vijayanagar Empire is completely built of granite blocks. 
It was built in the 16th century and frequently exchanged hands between various strong empires. But still it holds an aura about its personality that is inferior to none. The fort is now promoted by the state government as a historical tourist destination.
This is the main attraction of the Vellore city and sees the maximum number of foot falls to any attraction in the city.
